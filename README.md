# ppi-project: 8255 Verilog Implementation

Implement the 8255 PPI chip in verilog.
Note the following​​: The 8255 chip has two modes of operation, BSR mode and I/O mode. Inside the I/O Mode, there are three modes of operation.

Note:​​ There is no clock involved here at all. This is not a synchronous chip. This doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have registers. It does have registers, but it uses latches that don’t depend on clock edges.
